As in the previous task, the dependence of the number of threads and running 
time of the program is inversely proportional.
There is a minor difference in run time between ex3.c and ex4.c tasks
But with a great number of threads run time of programm 4 is bigger than for program 3.
It can be explained by the often mutex use.
